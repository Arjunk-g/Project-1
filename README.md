My favorite part of javaScript is being able to connect web APIs to make systems and worklows smoother.

I kinda like java script because it makes me feel like a programmer but also idk man.



I don't like JavaScript (. _ . )

I think i'll like javaScript more when i can sit in fron of a blank js file, be told to do something, and then execute it! (^_^)
